Like electromagnetism (QED), it is a gauge theory, where the force between charged particles originates in the exchange of intermediate massless vector bosons: one photon in the case of QED and eight gluons in the case of QCD. The gauge symmetry of QCD is based on the special unitary group, SU(3), and the associated charge is called color. Quarks carry three basic charges or colors: red, blue and green. QCD is extremely predictive.},
